# AnalizaDanych-KML

## Project objectives
Project aims to analyze various aspects related to shipments from Sweden,  addressing specific requirements. The focus lies in understanding the relationship between shipment types, transportation modes, destinations, and their impact on transportation costs. Additionally, the project aims to identify prevalent transportation modes, considering the latest ecological trends, and assess the popularity of different Incoterms along with the influencing factors. The analysis extends to carriers, evaluating their role based on transported volume (m3), destination, Incoterms, and transportation type. Furthermore, the project incorporates predictive modeling to forecast shipments over the next 2 years, providing valuable insights for effective planning and resource management. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a holistic analysis to optimize logistic processes, reduce costs, and align with dynamic market trends.

## project execution
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Conduct thorough data cleaning to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the shipment data. 
Standardize and preprocess the data to ensure uniformity and compatibility for analysis.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns in the shipment data.
Identify any correlations between variables that may impact the efficiency of logistics operations.

### Data visualization (EDA):

Determine which variables or data points are essential for the visualization to effectively communicate the intended message. 
Select appropriate visualization tools and techniques based on the nature of the data and the insights you want to convey. This may include charts, graphs, maps, or dashboards
Use chosen tools to generate visual representations of the data. This can involve the use of software, programming languages, or specialized visualization platforms.

### Predictive Modeling:

    Develop predictive models to forecast future shipment volumes and demand patterns.
    Explore machine learning algorithms to predict potential delays or bottlenecks in the logistics process.
